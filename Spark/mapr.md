### What is Spark used for?
- Stream processing: process in real time
- Machine learning
- Interactive analytics
- Data integration

### Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs)
- Transformations, which create a new RDD by changing the original through processes such as mapping, filtering, and more;
- Actions, such as counts, which measure but do not change the original data.
